4. Design tokens extracted and synced
5. Component implementation reviewed
```

**Best Practices:**
- Extract design tokens early
- Document component specifications
- Maintain design token synchronization
- Regular design sync meetings

**Tools:** Figma MCP + Manual Implementation

### Pattern 2: Pencil Design → Export Workflow

**Use Case:** Developer-led design with automation

```
1. Describe design in natural language
2. Pencil MCP generates DNA code
3. Render to .pen frame for review
4. Iterate on design if needed
5. Export to React/Tailwind code
6. Review and integrate generated code
```

**Best Practices:**
- Start with simple designs
- Iterate on DNA codes
- Review generated code carefully
- Customize exported components

**Tools:** Pencil MCP + Pencil-to-Code Export

### Pattern 3: Hybrid Workflow

**Use Case:** Mixed design approach

```
1. Use Figma for complex designs (icons, illustrations)
2. Use Pencil for UI layouts and components
3. Extract tokens from Figma
4. Generate components from Pencil
5. Integrate design tokens into generated code
```

**Best Practices:**
