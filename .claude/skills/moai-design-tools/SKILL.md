# Design Tools Integration Specialist

Comprehensive design-to-code workflow guidance covering three major capabilities: Figma MCP (design fetching), Pencil MCP (visual rendering), and Pencil-to-code export (React/Tailwind generation).

## Default Design Style (shadcn/ui Nova)

When no specific design style is requested, use the **shadcn/ui Nova** preset with Notion-style neutral color scheme:

```
bunx --bun shadcn@latest create --preset "https://ui.shadcn.com/init?base=radix&style=nova&baseColor=neutral&theme=neutral&iconLibrary=hugeicons&font=noto-sans&menuAccent=bold&menuColor=default&radius=small&template=next&rtl=false" --template next
```

### Nova Style Configuration

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Style | `nova` | Modern, clean design language |
| Base Color | `neutral` | Notion-style grayscale palette |
| Theme | `neutral` | Consistent neutral theming |
| Icon Library | `hugeicons` | Comprehensive icon set |
| Font | `noto-sans` | Clean, readable sans-serif |
| Radius | `small` | Subtle rounded corners |
| Menu Accent | `bold` | Strong menu highlighting |

### When to Use Default Style

Apply the Nova preset when:
- User requests "clean", "modern", or "minimalist" design without specifics
- No brand guidelines or design system specified
- Creating dashboards, admin panels, or productivity tools
- Building documentation or content-focused interfaces

## Quick Tool Selection

### Figma MCP - Design Context and Generation

Official Figma MCP integration via Remote MCP server (https://mcp.figma.com/mcp). Install with: `claude plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official`

Best For: Fetching design context from Figma files, extracting design tokens, generating new designs with Code-to-Canvas (generate_figma_design), accessing FigJam boards, and linking components to code with Code Connect.

Key Strengths: 16 official tools including read (get_design_context, get_variable_defs, get_screenshot, get_metadata), write (use_figma, generate_figma_design, create_new_file), Code Connect (get_code_connect_map, add_code_connect_map, get_code_connect_suggestions, send_code_connect_mappings), FigJam (get_figjam, generate_diagram), design system (search_design_system, create_design_system_rules), and utility (whoami). Write-to-canvas is currently free during beta.

Workflow: Install plugin → get_design_context → get_variable_defs → get_screenshot → Implement design → Verify against screenshot.

Context7 Library: /figma/docs

### Pencil MCP - Visual Design Rendering

Pencil MCP integration for creating and editing .pen design files (schema v2.9) with AI-assisted design generation. CLI: `@pencil.dev/cli` v0.2.4.

Best For: Rapid prototyping, visual design iterations, creating UI mockups from text descriptions, collaborative design discussions, visual proposals before implementation.

Key Strengths: Text-to-design conversion, batch design operations, style guide integration, visual preview without implementation, collaborative design workflow, component system with slots, design libraries (.lib.pen).

**Available Pencil MCP Tools (14 + 1 CLI-only):**

**Note:** .pen files are pure JSON (Git diffable, mergeable). 13 node types: Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Polygon, Path, Text, Frame, Group, Note, Prompt, Context, IconFont, Ref.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `batch_design` | Create, modify, and manipulate design elements in batches (Insert/Copy/Replace/Update/Delete/Move/Generate) |
| `batch_get` | Read design components and hierarchy by patterns or node IDs |
| `get_screenshot` | Render design previews as PNG images |
| `snapshot_layout` | Analyze computed layout structure with bounding boxes, detect overlaps |

| `get_style_guide` | Get style guide by name or tags |
| `get_style_guide_tags` | List all available style guide tags |
| `open_document` | Open existing .pen file or create new one |
| `find_empty_space_on_canvas` | Find available space for new elements |
| `export_nodes` | **CLI only** — Export to PNG, JPEG, WEBP, PDF with scale multiplier |

Workflow: Describe UI in natural language → Generate design with batch_design → Visually review with get_screenshot → Iterate on design → Export to code when ready.

**CLI Authentication:** `pencil login` (interactive) or `PENCIL_CLI_KEY` env var (CI/CD). Agent mode: `pencil --out file.pen --prompt "..." --model claude-sonnet-4-6`.

Context7 Library: /pencil/docs

### Pencil-to-Code Export - React/Tailwind Generation

Export .pen designs to production-ready React and Tailwind CSS code via a prompt-based workflow.

Best For: Converting approved .pen designs to implementation, generating React components with Tailwind styling, maintaining design fidelity in code, rapid frontend development from visual designs.

Key Strengths: Prompt-based code generation (no export API), batch_get for reading .pen JSON structure, design token extraction via get_variables, React component generation with Tailwind classes, component structure preservation.

Workflow: batch_get frame data → Analyze JSON structure → Map to React/Tailwind → Apply design tokens → Verify against screenshot.

Note: Pencil-to-Code is a prompt-based workflow. There is no `pencil.export_to_react()` API or `pencil.config.js` configuration file.

- Rapid frontend development from designs

## Pencil MCP Workflow

### Starting a Design Session

1. **Check Editor State**
   ```
   get_editor_state() → Determine active .pen file and user selection
   ```

2. **Open or Create Document**
   ```
   open_document(filePathOrNew: "new") → Create new .pen file
   open_document(filePathOrNew: "/path/to/file.pen") → Open existing
   ```

3. **Get Design Guidelines**
   ```
   get_guidelines(topic: "code" | "table" | "tailwind" | "landing-page")
   get_style_guide_tags() → Get available style tags
   get_style_guide(tags: ["minimalist", "dashboard"], name: "nova")
   ```

### Creating Designs

1. **Generate with batch_design**

   Use batch_design for efficient batch operations. Syntax:
   ```
   foo=I("parent", { ... })    // Insert new node
   baz=C("nodeid", "parent", { ... })  // Copy node
   foo2=R("nodeid1/nodeid2", {...})    // Replace node
   U(foo+"/nodeid", {...})     // Update node
   D("dfFAeg2")               // Delete node
   M("nodeid3", "parent", 2)   // Move node
   G("baz", "ai", "...")       // Generate image with AI
   ```

2. **Design with Default Nova Style**

   When creating components without user-specified style:
   - Use neutral color palette (grays, whites)
   - Apply small radius (4-6px)
   - Use Noto Sans or system sans-serif
   - Maintain clean, minimal aesthetic
   - Apply consistent 4px/8px spacing grid

3. **Review with get_screenshot**
   ```
   get_screenshot() → Visual validation of design
   ```

### Managing Design Tokens

1. **Read Variables**
   ```
   get_variables() → Current design tokens and themes
   ```

2. **Update Variables**
   ```
   set_variables(variables: { primary: "#3B82F6", ... })
   ```

### Layout Analysis

```
snapshot_layout() → Analyze computed layout rectangles
find_empty_space_on_canvas(direction: "right", size: { w: 200, h: 100 })
```

## Common Design-to-Code Patterns

### Universal Patterns

These patterns apply across all three tools with tool-specific implementations.

**Design Token Management:**

All tools support design token extraction and management. Figma MCP extracts tokens from existing files, Pencil MCP generates tokens during design creation, Pencil-to-code exports tokens as CSS variables or Tailwind config.

**Component Architecture:**

All tools maintain component hierarchy. Figma MCP reads component structure from Figma, Pencil MCP creates component structure in DNA codes, Pencil-to-code generates React components preserving hierarchy.

**Responsive Design:**

All tools handle responsive layouts. Figma MCP extracts responsive variants, Pencil MCP defines responsive breakpoints in DNA, Pencil-to-code generates Tailwind responsive classes.

**Style Consistency:**

All tools ensure design consistency. Figma MCP validates against design system, Pencil MCP enforces design tokens, Pencil-to-code applies consistent Tailwind classes.

### Workflow Best Practices

Applicable to all tools:

**Design System Integration:**
- Define design tokens before starting design work
- Use consistent naming conventions across tools
- Maintain single source of truth for design values
- Document token usage and component patterns

**Version Control:**
- Commit Figma metadata snapshots for reference
- Version .pen files in repository
- Track design iterations with git
- Document design decisions in code comments

**Collaboration:**
- Use Figma comments for design feedback
- Share .pen frames for visual review
- Create pull requests for design changes
- Maintain design documentation alongside code

**Quality Assurance:**
- Validate design tokens against style guide
- Test responsive breakpoints
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Review generated code for optimization

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="rationalizations" -->
## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I can implement the design from the screenshot, I do not need Figma context" | Screenshots lose component structure, spacing tokens, and interaction states. Figma MCP provides structured design data. |
| "Pencil files are just for designers, developers do not need them" | Pencil files contain layout constraints and component hierarchy. Developers use them as the source of truth for implementation. |
| "I will export to code and clean it up" | Generated code is a starting point, not a deliverable. Export without review produces non-semantic, non-accessible markup. |
| "Design tokens are too rigid, I need custom values" | Custom values bypass the design system. Extend tokens through the system, not around it. |
| "I will sync with the designer after implementation" | Post-implementation sync means rework. Sync before implementation means alignment. |

<!-- moai:evolvable-end -->

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="red-flags" -->
## Red Flags

- Implementation uses hardcoded values instead of design tokens from Figma or Pencil
- Exported code committed without semantic HTML cleanup
- Interaction states (hover, focus, active, disabled) missing from implementation
- Pencil file updated but implementation not synced
- Design tool export contains absolute positioning that breaks responsive layout

<!-- moai:evolvable-end -->

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="verification" -->
## Verification

- [ ] Design tokens from Figma or Pencil used for colors, spacing, and typography
- [ ] All interaction states implemented (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- [ ] Exported code cleaned up with semantic HTML and accessibility attributes
- [ ] Implementation matches design file at all breakpoints (compare visually)
- [ ] No hardcoded pixel values where design tokens are available
