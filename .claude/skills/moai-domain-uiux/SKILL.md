## Quick Reference

Core UI/UX Foundation - Enterprise-grade UI/UX foundation integrating design systems (W3C DTCG 2025.10), component architecture (React 19, Vue 3.5), accessibility (WCAG 2.2), icon libraries (200K+ icons), and theming systems.

Unified Capabilities:

- Design Systems: W3C DTCG 2025.10 tokens, Style Dictionary 4.0, Pencil MCP workflows

## Implementation Guide

### Foundation Stack

Core Technologies:

- React 19 with Server Components and Concurrent Rendering
- TypeScript 5.9+ with full type safety and improved inference
- Tailwind CSS 4.x with CSS-first configuration, CSS variables, and dark mode
- Radix UI for unstyled accessible primitives
- W3C DTCG 2025.10 for design token specification
- Style Dictionary 4.0 for token transformation
- Pencil MCP for design-to-code automation
- Storybook 8.x for component documentation

Quick Decision Guide:

For design tokens, use modules/design-system-tokens.md with DTCG 2025.10 and Style Dictionary 4.0.

For component patterns, use modules/component-architecture.md with Atomic Design, React 19, and shadcn/ui.

For accessibility, use modules/accessibility-wcag.md with WCAG 2.2, jest-axe, and keyboard navigation.

For icons, use modules/icon-libraries.md with Lucide, React Icons, Tabler, Iconify, and Hugeicons.

For Nova preset and design presets, use moai-design-tools skill (reference/pencil-renderer.md).

For theming, use modules/theming-system.md with CSS variables and Theme Provider.

For practical examples, use examples.md with React and Vue implementations.

## Quick Start Workflows

### Design System Setup

Step 1: Initialize design tokens by creating a JSON file with DTCG schema URL. Define color tokens with type color and primary 500 value. Define spacing tokens with type dimension and md value of 1rem.

Step 2: Transform tokens with Style Dictionary by installing the package and running the build command.

Step 3: Integrate with components by importing colors and spacing from the tokens directory.

See modules/design-system-tokens.md for complete token architecture.

### Component Library Setup

Step 1: Initialize shadcn/ui by running the init command, then add button, form, and dialog components.

Step 2: Set up Atomic Design structure with atoms directory for Button, Input, and Label components, molecules directory for FormGroup and Card components, and organisms directory for DataTable and Modal components.

Step 3: Implement with accessibility by adding aria-label attributes to interactive elements.

See modules/component-architecture.md for patterns and examples.

### Icon System Integration

Step 1: Choose icon library based on needs. Install lucide-react for general purpose, iconify/react for maximum variety, or tabler/icons-react for dashboard optimization.

Step 2: Implement type-safe icons by importing specific icons and applying className for sizing and color.

See modules/icon-libraries.md for library comparison and optimization.

### Theme System Setup

Step 1: Configure CSS variables in root selector for primary and background colors. Define dark class with inverted values for dark mode.

Step 2: Implement Theme Provider by wrapping the application with attribute set to class and defaultTheme set to system.

See modules/theming-system.md for complete theme system.

## Key Principles

Design Token First:

- Single source of truth for design decisions
- Semantic naming using color.primary.500 format rather than blue-500
- Multi-theme support for light and dark modes
- Platform-agnostic transformation

Accessibility by Default:

- WCAG 2.2 AA minimum with 4.5:1 text contrast
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Focus management and visible indicators

Component Composition:

- Atomic Design hierarchy from Atoms to Molecules to Organisms
- Props API for reusability
- Variant-based styling rather than separate components
- Type-safe with TypeScript

Performance Optimization:

- Tree-shaking for icons by importing specific icons rather than all
- Lazy loading for large components
- React.memo for expensive renders
- Bundle size monitoring

---

## Best Practices

Required Practices:

Use design tokens exclusively for all color, spacing, and typography values. Design tokens provide a single source of truth, enabling consistent theming, multi-platform support, and scalable design systems. Hardcoded values create maintenance debt and break theme switching.

Include ARIA labels on all icon-only interactive elements. Screen readers cannot interpret visual icons without text alternatives. Missing ARIA labels violate WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.

Import icons individually rather than using namespace imports. Namespace imports bundle entire libraries, defeating tree-shaking optimization. Bundle sizes increase by 500KB-2MB per icon library.

Test all components in both light and dark modes. Theme switching affects color contrast, readability, and accessibility compliance.

Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive components. Keyboard-only users require Tab, Enter, Escape, and Arrow key support.

Provide visible focus indicators for all focusable elements. Focus indicators communicate current keyboard position for navigation and accessibility.

Use Tailwind utility classes instead of inline styles. Tailwind provides consistent spacing scale, responsive design, and automatic purging for optimal bundle sizes.

Include loading states for all asynchronous operations. Loading states provide feedback during data fetching, preventing user uncertainty.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Accessibility is a nice-to-have, not a requirement" | WCAG compliance is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions. It is also a core quality dimension, not optional. |
| "Dark mode is just inverting colors" | Naive inversion breaks contrast ratios, image visibility, and semantic color meanings. Dark mode is a design exercise. |
| "The design system is too rigid, I need custom styles" | Custom styles that bypass the design system create inconsistency. Extend the system instead of working around it. |
| "Icons do not need labels, they are self-explanatory" | Icons are ambiguous without context. Screen readers cannot describe unlabeled icons. Always add aria-label. |
| "I will handle responsive design at the end" | Responsive retrofitting breaks layouts. Design for the smallest viewport first, then enhance. |

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="red-flags" -->
## Red Flags

- Interactive element has no visible focus indicator
- Color contrast ratio below 4.5:1 for normal text
- Icon used without aria-label or accompanying text
- Design token bypassed with hardcoded color or spacing value
- No dark mode variant defined for a new component
- Responsive breakpoints absent from new layout components

<!-- moai:evolvable-end -->

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="verification" -->
## Verification

- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text) (show contrast check output)
- [ ] All interactive elements have visible focus indicators
- [ ] Icons have accessible names (aria-label or accompanying visible text)
- [ ] Design tokens used for colors, spacing, and typography (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Dark mode renders correctly without broken contrast or invisible elements
- [ ] Layout tested at mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px) widths
