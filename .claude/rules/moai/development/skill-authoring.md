# Skill Authoring

Guidelines for creating MoAI skills following the Agent Skills open standard (agentskills.io).

## YAML Frontmatter Schema

MoAI skills follow the Agent Skills standard with MoAI-specific extensions.

### Standard Fields (agentskills.io)

Required fields:
- name: Skill identifier, lowercase with hyphens, max 64 characters (system: moai-{category}-{name}, user: custom-{name})
- description: Purpose description using YAML folded scalar (>), max 1024 characters

Optional standard fields:
- license: SPDX license identifier (default: Apache-2.0)
- compatibility: Target platform description, max 500 characters (default: Designed for Claude Code)
- allowed-tools: Comma-separated string of tool names the skill can use (experimental)
- user-invocable: Boolean to control slash command menu visibility (default: true, set to false to hide from / menu)
- disable-model-invocation: Boolean, when true only user can invoke (not Claude). Use for workflows with side effects (default: false)
- effort: Session effort override: low, medium, high, xhigh, max (xhigh/max require Opus 4.7+)
- model: Model override when skill is active (sonnet, opus, haiku)
- shell: Shell for command injection: bash (default) or powershell
- context: Set to "fork" to run skill in forked subagent context (isolated execution)
- agent: Subagent type when context is fork. Built-in: Explore, Plan, general-purpose, or custom agent name
- hooks: Hook definitions scoped to skill lifecycle
- paths: Glob patterns limiting auto-invocation to matching files (comma-separated or YAML array)

### metadata Map

Key-value pairs where both keys and values MUST be strings. Used for simple custom properties.

Common metadata keys:
- version: Semantic version as string (e.g., "1.0.0")
- category: foundation, workflow, domain, language, platform, library, tool
- status: active, experimental, deprecated
- updated: ISO date as string (e.g., "2026-01-28")
- modularized: Whether content is split into modules ("true" or "false")
- tags: Comma-separated tag list as single string
- author: Skill author name
- context7-libraries: Comma-separated library identifiers for Context7 MCP
- related-skills: Comma-separated related skill names
- aliases: Comma-separated alternative names
- argument-hint: Usage hint for user-invocable skills
- context: Contextual description for skill behavior
- agent: Target agent name

### MoAI Extension Fields

Complex structured fields kept at top level with standardized comments.

progressive_disclosure: Token optimization configuration
- enabled: boolean
- level1_tokens: approximate tokens for metadata level
- level2_tokens: approximate tokens for body level

triggers: Loading trigger conditions
- keywords: list of trigger keywords
- agents: list of agent names that load this skill
- phases: list of workflow phases
- languages: list of programming languages

### Schema Example

```yaml
---
name: moai-example-skill
description: >
  Brief description of what this skill does, max 1024 characters.
  Use YAML folded scalar (>) for multi-line descriptions.
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Designed for Claude Code
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__context7__get-library-docs
user-invocable: false
effort: low
shell: bash
model: sonnet
metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
  category: "domain"
  status: "active"
  updated: "2026-01-28"
  modularized: "false"
  tags: "example, demo, template"

# MoAI Extension: Progressive Disclosure
progressive_disclosure:
  enabled: true
  level1_tokens: 100
  level2_tokens: 5000

# MoAI Extension: Triggers
triggers:
  keywords: ["example", "demo"]
  agents: ["expert-backend"]
  phases: ["run"]
---
```

### Key Format Rules

allowed-tools format: [HARD] Comma-separated string ONLY. Space-separated values are PROHIBITED.
- Correct: `allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`
- WRONG: `allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob Bash` (YAML parses as single string scalar, silently breaks tool permissions)
- YAML arrays also supported since v2.1.0 but CSV is the MoAI convention

metadata values: All values must be quoted strings.
- Correct: `version: "1.0.0"`
- Wrong: `version: 1.0.0`

description format: Use YAML folded scalar (>) for readability.
- Correct: `description: >\n  Multi-line description here.`
- Wrong: `description: "Long description in quotes"`

## Progressive Disclosure

Three-level system for token efficiency:

Level 1 (Metadata):
- Tokens: ~100
- Content: name, description, version, triggers
- Loading: Always for skills in agent frontmatter

Level 2 (Body):
- Tokens: ~5000
- Content: Full documentation, code examples
- Loading: When trigger conditions match

Level 3 (Bundled):
- Tokens: Variable
- Content: reference.md, modules/, examples/
- Loading: On-demand by Claude

## Tool Permissions by Category

Foundation Skills:
- Allowed: Read, Grep, Glob, Context7 MCP
- Never: Bash, Agent

Workflow Skills:
- Allowed: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash, TodoWrite
- Conditional: AskUserQuestion (MoAI only), Agent (managers only)

Domain Skills:
- Allowed: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
- Conditional: Write, Edit (implementation tasks only)
- Never: AskUserQuestion, Agent

Language Skills:
- Allowed: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Context7 MCP
- Conditional: Write, Edit (implementation tasks only)
- Never: AskUserQuestion, Agent

## Trigger Configuration

```yaml
triggers:
  keywords: ["api", "database", "authentication"]
  agents: ["manager-spec", "expert-backend"]
  phases: ["plan", "run"]
  languages: ["python", "typescript"]
```

## Agent Initialization

### initialPrompt

Agents can specify an initial prompt that auto-submits when the agent starts. This enables agents to begin work immediately without waiting for user input. Available since Claude Code v2.1.83+.

The initialPrompt field is only applicable to agent definitions (.claude/agents/), not skills.

Example:
```yaml
---
name: my-agent
initialPrompt: "Analyze the following code for performance issues: @.src/"
---
```

## Built-in Variables

Variables available inside skill SKILL.md content:

| Variable | Description | Available Since |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` | Absolute path to the skill's own directory | v2.1.69 |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session identifier | v2.1.9 |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | Plugin root directory (plugin skills only) | v2.0.12 |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments passed when invoking skill | v2.1.0 |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]` | Specific argument by 0-based index (e.g., `$ARGUMENTS[0]`) | v2.1.0 |
| `$N` | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]` (e.g., `$0`, `$1`) | v2.1.0 |

Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` for referencing files within the skill directory instead of relative paths. This is more reliable across different invocation contexts.

If skill content does not reference `$ARGUMENTS`, Claude Code automatically appends `ARGUMENTS: <value>` at the end of the skill content.

## Skill Invocation Control

Three invocation modes control how skills appear and load:

| Setting | User invokes | Claude invokes | Description loaded | Use case |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| (default / user-invocable: true) | Yes | Yes | Always | Standard skills |
| disable-model-invocation: true | Yes | No | No | Workflows with side effects |
| user-invocable: false | No | Yes | Always | Background knowledge |

When `disable-model-invocation: true` is set, the skill is NOT loaded into Claude's context, so Claude cannot auto-invoke it. Use for skills that perform destructive actions.

When `user-invocable: false` is set, the skill is hidden from the `/` menu but Claude can still invoke it as background knowledge. Use for reference material.

## Shell Command Injection

Skills support dynamic context via shell command injection. Commands run BEFORE skill content is sent to Claude, and their output replaces the placeholder in the skill content.

Inline syntax: Use exclamation-backtick notation to inject a single command's output inline.

Multi-line syntax: Use a triple-backtick fence with exclamation mark as the language identifier to run multiple commands sequentially.

Policy control: Disable with `disableSkillShellExecution: true` in settings.json. Each command placeholder is replaced with `[shell command execution disabled by policy]`.

## Skill Scope and Priority

Skills can exist at multiple levels. When the same name exists across levels, higher priority wins:

| Priority | Location | Path | Scope |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| 1 (highest) | Enterprise | Per managed settings | All org users |
| 2 | Personal | ~/.claude/skills/name/SKILL.md | All projects |
| 3 | Project | .claude/skills/name/SKILL.md | This project |
| 4 (lowest) | Plugin | plugin/skills/name/SKILL.md | Where enabled (uses plugin-name:skill-name namespace) |

## Best Practices

- Use minimum required permissions
- Prefer Read before Write/Edit operations
- Prefer Edit over Bash for file modifications
- Include 5-10 keywords per skill for accurate triggering
- Overestimate token usage by 10-20% for safety
- Use YAML folded scalar (>) for description field
- Keep all metadata values as quoted strings
- Use comma-separated format for allowed-tools (YAML arrays also supported since v2.1.0)
- Mark MoAI extension fields with standardized comments
- Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` for self-referencing paths within skill content
- Keep skill descriptions under 250 characters for menu display (v2.1.86+)
